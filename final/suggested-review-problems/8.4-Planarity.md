# Suggested review (8.4 - Planar Graphs)
## Girth, regions, vertices, and Euler's formula
- Draw a graph with girth 4.
- What is the inequality relating girth `k` with `|R|` and `|E|`?
- Use this, and Euler's formula, to relate `|E|`, `|V|`, and `k`.
- Use the above to solve the special case of triangle-free setups, i.e., `k=4`.
- Use a similar line of reasoning to prove `K5` and `K3,3` are non-planar.
## Textbook problems
- 11, 12, 13, 16 (similar to above)
- 2, 7 (drawings)
- 3, 10 (determine when `Kn` and `Km,n` are non-planar)
