As stated in the handout, if you answer a question (in class participation) correctly, you will be given a bonus check mark. These bonus check marks will convert into a bonus at the end of the semester. The person with the most bonus check marks will receive a 2 percentage points grade boost. Each student will receive a grade boost that is at least proportional to this maximum based on the number of bonus check marks. (As always, I reserve the right to make an upward adjustment.)

This is on an honor system, you record the number of bonus check marks that you earn in every class.
