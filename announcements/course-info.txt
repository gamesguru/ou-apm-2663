Dear APM 2663 students,

You are receiving this email because you have registered for APM 2663 in the upcoming semester. The handout for the class has been posted on Moodle. Please read the handout.
 
1) This is an on-campus class.
 
2) Please pay attention to announcement on Moodle.
 
3) As pointed out in the course handout, lectures may be recorded using Panopto (integrated with Moodle) but it is not a guarantee.
 
4) The student solutions manual is available on Moodle now. Yes. Free.
 
5) I would like to point out that I understand textbooks are expensive. The library has a copy on reserve. Moreover, OU has many textbooks that are available for students to download.
 
https://link-springer-com.huaryu.kl.oakland.edu/book/10.1007%2F978-0-8176-8286-6
https://link-springer-com.huaryu.kl.oakland.edu/book/10.1007/978-3-319-44561-8
and the open textbook http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3.html
collectively cover almost all the topics from the official textbook plus many more additional topics.
 
In addition, https://link-springer-com.huaryu.kl.oakland.edu/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-92645-2 contains many exercises with hints/answers/solutions.
 
So these resources collectively may provide a good free alternative.
 
6) Please pay extra attentions to the dates of various assessments in the course.
