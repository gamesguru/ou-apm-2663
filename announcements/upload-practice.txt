This is to remind you that we have technology evaluation on September 17. On that day, I will give you a "quiz" and you have to scan all the pages of the quiz into one pdf file and submit it to Moodle. All activities must be done via your phone/tablet only. Please see the handout for suggested apps (free) to do the scanning.

I have created an "assignment" labelled Upload Practice for you to practice this task.

If you do not have a smart phone/tablet, please contact me by September 10.
