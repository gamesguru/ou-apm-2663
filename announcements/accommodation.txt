As stated in the handout, please note the dates of the quizzes, tests and final exam to ensure that you can be there on these days (barring any unforeseen emergencies). If you will be away on official university business such as competing in athletic events on these days, you need to inform me within the first week of the semester (or within 3 days of knowledge of such events, if the information is not available at the beginning of the semester) so that we can make arrangement. For example, the athletic office provides letters to be given to the instructors. If you require DSS accommodation, you need to inform me within 3 days of the issuance of the DSS accommodation letter by giving me the letter.
