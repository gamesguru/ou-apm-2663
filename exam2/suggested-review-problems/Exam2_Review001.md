# Suggested review problems
## 4.1 `gcd`
- Write `gcd(126, 100)` as a linear combination of 126 & 100.
- Prove that `gcd(x+1, x)=1` by applying Euclid's algorithm.
## 5.3 Induction
- Prove: `1+4+7+...+(3n-2)=n(3n-1)/2` [Oct 15 lecture]
## 6.3 Combs and Perms (w/ repetitions)
**"k + n - 1 choose k"**
- Be able to recite this formula even if woken from a drunken stupor. It's `k` indistinct balls going in `n` distinct boxes, i.e., stars and bars `x1+x2+...+xn = k`, i.e., 7 candies 4 friends: `****|**||*` or `x1+x2+x3+x4=7` has `C(10, 7)=120` solutions.
