- 12(c) [HINT from Cheng: 'I did have an example involving slack variables but I did not use the term. Remember the one where we distribute candies to students but we donâ€™t have to distribute all of them? The solution is to treat the teacher as one of the students for the leftover. So the teacher is a "slack variable."']
