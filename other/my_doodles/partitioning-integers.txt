Let's partition 6.

This can be done 11 ways.

6
5+1
4+2
4+1+1
3+3
3+2+1
3+1+1+1
2+2+2
2+2+1+1
2+1+1+1+1
1+1+1+1+1+1

Let's write a formula to describe 3-parts since those are the most common.

x1 + x2 + x3 = 6

But x1, x2, and x3 must be greater than zero, hence we can recenter each var around zero for the cost of 3:

x1' + x2' + x3' = 3

This has 5C3 solutions, which is 5C2, which is 10.
But order is unimportant to us, so
